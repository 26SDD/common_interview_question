Interesting question about probability.

Q1 : You are picking N balls one by one from a K balls pile, where K means balls are numbered from 1~k, inclusively (N < K). What's the odd that the N balls are in assending order? eg: 

K = 10, N = 4, four balls are 1,2,3,4;

K = 20, N = 3, three balls are 10,19,20.

A1: 1/(N!). Thinking process: no matter whatever the combination you pick from pile, there is **ONLY** one combination meets the requirement, which means one out of N!.
