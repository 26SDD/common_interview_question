What cross validation technique would you use on time series data set? Is it k-fold or LOOCV? and why?

Neither.

We should use forward chaining strategy instead. B/C pattern in t1 may not exist in t2.

ps: K-fold, generally we use 10, but there is nothing wrong to use 5,6,7,8,9...
LOOCV: Leave-one-out cross-validation, special case of LpOCV where p == 1, {\displaystyle C_{1}^{n}=n} {\displaystyle C_{1}^{n}=n}
