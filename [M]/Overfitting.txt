what will you do when (you realize) overfitting?

I think I can seperate this question into two parts.

First part is about method/tech WILL solve/improve this problem.
Second part is about method/tech MIGHT solve/improve this problem, but not necessarily so and may cause other problems.

P1:

Regularization, and by default L2.
Average models, Blender, cross-validation.

P2:

This is the tricky part, b/c what I said can be easily challenged by the interviewer. 

Introduce more data,
Introduce new model,
Random forest, set tree size large.
Try to simplify model, e.g for NN, reduce neuros in hidden layer, may cause underfitting though.

Use PCA, (k = 2 or 3) to visualize data. (I never mean use PCA to solve overfitting, just
visualize, and honestly we do not need PCA to do this, we can simply calculate AVG âˆ‘ (x)^2). Does the dataset has high variance? y -> go bagging, n-> if you are using GD or SGD, stop earlier (less iteration).
