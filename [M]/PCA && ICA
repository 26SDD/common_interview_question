 what are they?
 
 difference?
 
 Why do we need them? How to compute them? More about them.
 
 #####
 
 PCA == Principal component analysis, ICA == independent component analysis
 
 PCA is for data compression/visualization, lower from N dimension to K dimension
 
 PCA wants to maintaince like 99% variance.Say data has N dimensions and M examples.
 
 Before PCA, feature scaling/ mean normalization, then feed covariance matrix to SVD, SVD[m] -> [U,S,V] -> 
 U is a n*n matrix -> take the first K column of U -> U[k], U[k] is n * k, x is n * 1, 
 z(i) = U[k]^T (transpose) * x(i), z(i) -> k * 1, dataaaa, lower the dimension successfully.Also, 
 we can use EIG instead of SVD.
 
 How to choose k?
 1. We can pre-selecet a K.
 2.            k
               ∑(Sii)
               i = 1
     1 -      -------    <= 0.01      where S is a n * n matrix from the SVD,
               n
               ∑(Sii)
               i = 1
               
               
     or try different k, compute U[k] or someone prefers U(reduce), just notation. x(p) = U[k] * z,
     average squared projection error = 1/m ∑ (x(i) - x(pi))^2 (from 1 to m)
     total variation  = 1/m ∑ (x(i))^2 (from 1 to m),
     we want ASPE/TV <= 0.01 (or other target)
