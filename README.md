# common_interview_question
answer/solution/pseudo code for common Software Engineering/Data Science/Machine Learning question.

Mainly in Python3. Exception is that in other language, there is an elegant way. And by default, questions asked are based on Python3.

Answers  are based on my knowledge (so far), might not be 100% right and I will keep up-to-date.

P.S. be more specific Python 3.5.2
P.S. If something appears in java, it will be java 8 instead of java 9.

[S] == Software Engineering
[D] == Data Science
[M] == Machine Learning
