this is very common, you have a big file ,and it is very possible that it is too big to load into memory.how do you reverse it?
readsize(file)
read(file, offset, block) 
write(file, offset, block) are provided

Q1: is using temp file allowed? have to reverse it in space or not?

Q2: will the file actually be a small size file?

edge case: the left part(in the middle) size is smaller than the block size
