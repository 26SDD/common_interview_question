Q: you want to select one dynamic set data structure, which stores a set of values, and also has a getNearest function.
e.g. you have [1,10,20], when you call getNearest(11), it would return 10. If you will call addItem, removeItem, getNearest
almost evenly, which data structure is better? (of cause the fastest one) and why?

1. sorted array
2. unsorted linked list
3. (balanced) BST
4*. a hashset from numbers to the nearest value to them in the set

4: (my understanding) e.g given [1,17,19,20] and choose 19 as the number, the set will be [19,20,17,1] diff is [1,2,18].

QtA: what if getNearest could return two answers? say getNearest(15)? Overall this should not affect your choice, but return
the smaller one.
