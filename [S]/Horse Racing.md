The original problem is the classic 25 horses find top3 without a stopwatch. (the answer is 7)
And I was thinking of a more general version, Given N horses, you are allowed to race at most M horses, how many races do you need to find the top K horses? ,to make things easier, let's start with N>P>k.

After discuss with my firend, there are too many branches about N,P,K relationship, and once you can understand why the original question's answer is 7, you are fine.
